# <a href="https://it-incubator.io/">It-incubator</a> Split 1. Front-end
The month of training in the incubator ended with independent work. The task was this:
1. Write a counter that counts up to 5.
2. When we reach 5:
    - the number increases and becomes red.
    - the zoom button becomes unavailable for pressing.
3. When the counter value is 0: the reset button is disabled.
   The task is to perform using the knowledge gained in the course of training. Creating styles is a secondary task.
